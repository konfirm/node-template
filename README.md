# Project template

Basic Node.js project template, helps to set up the basics real quick.


## Installation

```
$ npx degit konfirm/node-project-template <project>

$ cd <project>
```

At this point you may want to search and replace `PROJECT_NAME` within the project with the project name

```
$ npm install
```


## Structure

### Dependencies
All dependencies are development only:
 - [`@konfirm/labrat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@konfirm/labrat) - BDD syntax exposure of [Hapi's Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab) test framework
 - [`eslint-config-strict`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-strict)

### Folders
The folder structure is simple:

 - /source - The folder where the actual module source code resides
 - /test - The starting point of all unit tests
 - /test/index.spec.js - Bootstrap of the `@konfirm/labrat` package, preparing all basics for [Hapi's Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab) test framework.
 - /test/source/* - sources to test, allows for using the same structure as the actual source folder

## Configuration
The configuration is both basic and opiniated
 - `.editorconfig` - uses tabs (except for package.json)
 - `.eslintrc.json` - some additional restrictions and relaxing settings for eslint-config-strict
 - `.npmignore` - Ignores the test folder and configuration files from being published
